We're doin it live! We're going to use an existing site as a guide to block our page, completely, before we add any data. We'll see if we can do it all in one go.

## Examining the components we'll need
We'll go outside in and figure out what we need:

 - Intro to dynamic routing
 - Have a good look at the design template (which happens to be a working site)
 - Outline/note what goes where. Use whatever tool you like.
 - Jot down notes in a design plan _somewhere_. Or just stub the components?

## The big stuff
We're moving outside in, refactoring smaller as we go. We will, hopefully, move slowly and be able to back track.
 
 - Block the major elements (organisms)
 - Extract the molecules
 - Take a stab at a naming convention

## Wiring it all up, making it work
We won't be using live data, but we can stub some out and see if things will move the way we like.

 - Check the responsive design! We should do this from the start but...
 - Create the store(s) we need, add lorem data
 - Refactor, as needed
