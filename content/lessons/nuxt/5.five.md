In this episode we'll get off the ground quickly and with a little repetition if you've watched the foundation stuff.

## What We're Going to Build
Ideally we're going to build the app that you're watching this video on! I'll have this course available in a number of locations - but the goal is that you're building what you see. 

 - A quick tour of existing applications, including my reference site
 - References and docs that you'll find useful as we go along

## Shut Up Already, Let's Code
Right, off we go! Pick a working directory and 

```
npx nuxi@latest init red4
cd red4
npm i
code .
```

I'm using VS Code and `code .` is the shortcut for opening the current directory in it. If you're using something else, just open the directory as usual. 

To look around, run `npm run dev`.

## Install Vuetify
We need to install the package and then wire it to Nuxt:

```
npm install vuetify
```

Once finished, we need to add the package as a plugin to Nuxt. Inside the root of your project:

```
mkdir plugins
touch plugins/vuetify.js
```

Add this code to the `plugins/vuetify.js` file:

```js
import '@mdi/font/css/materialdesignicons.css'
import 'vuetify/styles'

const vuetify = createVuetify({
  ssr: true,
})
```

Finally, in the root is a file called `nuxt.config.ts` and we need to tell it to include the Vuetify plugin:

```js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  telemetry: false, //add this so we don't forget
  css: [
    "vuetify/lib/styles/main.sass"
  ],
  build: {
    transpile: ['vuetify'],
  },
  vite: {
    define: {
      'process.env.DEBUG': false,
    },
  },
})
```

## A Test Layout
To make sure everything looks good, pop open `app.vue` and add this:

```html
<template>
  <v-card>
    <v-layout>
      <v-app-bar title="Application bar"></v-app-bar>

      <v-navigation-drawer>
        <v-list>
          <v-list-item title="Navigation drawer"></v-list-item>
        </v-list>
      </v-navigation-drawer>

      <v-main style="min-height: 300px;"></v-main>
    </v-layout>
  </v-card>
</template>
```
