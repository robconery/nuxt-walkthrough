You're likely aware of Vue to some level so I figure it would be a nice idea to start right here: *why Vue instead of React?* This obviously suggests that one is quantitatively better but that's not the case: they both do the same thing.

React has a much larger footprint and ecosystem than Vue, which is very important, but Vue is very close behind. That said, there are more important things: like how the concepts of a framework align with your own thinking.

That's what we're going to dig into.
