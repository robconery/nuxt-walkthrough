We have the "organisms" on our page (nav bars, drawer, etc) now it's time to go a bit deeper and add more value. We'll start with a store that our design can use.

## Creating a course store
We'll be pulling data from somewhere and our components need to use it! Pinia!

 - Faster now: declaring the store
 - Creating mock data
 - Stubbing out methods based on our design brief

## The Top Navigation
Let's fill out the top nav stuff in our `v-app-bar`:

 - Logo and collapse
 - Course links
 - User icon

## The Module List (topics and lessons)
I hate the word module but whatever. This is a list of all of the content in our course, sorted and organized by topic or category.
 
 - The course nav, with title
 - The lesson nav, with completed check, free indicator, and unwatched indicator (currently a play icon in our mockup)

## The Lesson (video, text, commands) 

 - The video slide (not logged in)
 - The lesson text
 - Lesson command list
