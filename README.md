# Episode 9: Course page molecules, part 2
We got hung up a bit on the nav bar, but the hopefully the rest of the course page will be straightforward.

## Setting up links for the lessons
Our routing is in place, so let's turn on the nav!

 - Adding a link
 - Noting which is active
 - Showing which is free

## The Top Navigation
Let's fill out the top nav stuff in our `v-app-bar`:

 - Logo and collapse
 - Course links
 - User icon

## The Lesson (video, text, commands) 

 - The video slide (not logged in)
 - The lesson text
 - Lesson command list
