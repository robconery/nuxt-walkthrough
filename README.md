# Episode 24: It's Time To Refactor/Redo

## Off Camera
 - Changed the Completed/Prev/Next buttons

## Let's Stop and Think
It's the Great Tempation of every programmer: _I could rebuild this thing over the weekend_. That's not what's happening here.

Every application gets to a "tipping point" and rarely, in my experience, do we ever do things righ the first time. If you do... you're rad.

This is where we are. 

## Alternatives to Consider
I've mentioned these things before, but it's time to seriously consider...

 - A hosted backend, like Pocketbase, Supabase or Firebase
 - A more complete backend API
 - A hosted auth solution
