# Episode 2: Menus, Data-driven UI, Branding and Styling
Material design is OK, but it's more fun if we can use our own as we want!

## Off Camera
I added a logo and a favicon as we're going to build this "outside-in". Also init'd a git repo. The idea here is you can `git log` to see the commit for each episode and checkout as you need.

## Material Design Options
We can tweak things as we need:

 - Get to know Vuetify docs better
 - Use different design themes (1, 2 or 3)
 - Use our own font styles overriding Vuetify
 - Tweaking colors (not something I'm going to do)

## Menus
We need to add three and we'll start out hard-coding then move to more idiomatic ways of doing things:

 - Main (top of nav)
 - Link to Video Page
 - Footer with Social and Site (help, terms, about and so on)
