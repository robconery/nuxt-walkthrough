# Episode 6: Application state with Pinia
We’re working our way “outside in”, almost like hopping down the side of a building in Elden Ring, and we’ve reached the middle tier, descending from the components above.

## Meet Pinia
Pinia is an optional centralized state store for larger applications, and we’re going to need it!

 - Install Pinia and fail!
 - Defining our first store, two ways.

## Creating a Content Store

 - Creating the `content` store
 - Refactoring our existing pages and components
 - Discussion: how far do we take this?

 - The Reactive Pattern, quickly. Like global variables, but improved!
 - How to make something reactive in Vue, both old school and new
 - Dealing with confusion, Part 1
