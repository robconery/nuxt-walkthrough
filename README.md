# Episode 25: Supabase Authentication
We can't query our store unless we know who the user is, so let's add that quickly.

## Adding Auth
Follow [the Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-nuxt-3) and add authentication to our app.

 - Work in a branch, of course!
 - Just using email link for now
 - Replace our current auth and blow up some code!

## Creating an API Abstraction
We don't want Supabase code littered throughout the app so let's be sure to centralize it somewhere, in case we have to swerve later.

 - Create an API store (?)
